HOW TO TEST THE CRUD.
-Create empty database and name it new_ongeza on phpmyadmin in xampp or wampp local server.
-Select that empty database and click import, so as to import the database.
-Click choose file and choose the file in the ongeza crud folder named new_ongeza.sql.giz
-After import, and ensuring mysql and apache  are started on your local server, go to web browser and type localhost/ongeza/index.php
-Well, you will be directed to the CRUD.

-NOTE: if you donâ€™t see the beauty interface, you need to firstly have data access and copy the URLs of stylesheet and src in the 
index file, and paste into web browser and search. Then if you refresh the CRUD it will look as it is supposed to be.
